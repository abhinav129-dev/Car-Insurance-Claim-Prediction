# ðŸš— Car Insurance Claim Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a car insurance policyholder will file a claim. By leveraging historical insurance data, the model helps insurance companies assess risk and make data-driven decisions for policy pricing and customer targeting.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify whether an individual is likely to make an insurance claim based on features such as age, vehicle type, driving history, annual premium, and more. The solution uses machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and scalable predictions.

ðŸ§  Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

ðŸ“Š Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and trends using heatmaps, pair plots, and correlation matrices.

Model Training & Evaluation: Trained multiple classification models and compared performance using classification metrics.

Result Interpretation: Interpreted model predictions to understand key risk factors associated with insurance claims.
